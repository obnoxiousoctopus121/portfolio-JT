<p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> In my CSCI 1300 course, User Interfaces and User Experiences, my team and I were tasked with creating an interface which tackled an issue that an exisiting startup was trying to solve for. 
We decided to create a mobile app interface for the startup LunaJoy, a precision mental health platform that focuses on delivering care by 
creating a specialized workforce to provide targeted psychotherapy, medication management + genetic testing, coaching, and holistic wellness.  We believe these 
users would be most impacted by our app because of our focus on the unique health issues that female identifying individuals experience through their different phases of life.</p>

<h4 style = "text-align: left;  color:rgb(33, 47, 87);  margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"><b> planning and designing </h4></b>

<p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> To create a hollistic approach to mental health, I wanted to incorporate hormonal, menstural, and internal medical
information that would otherwise be addressed by separate health providers. Since  medication, horomones, and mesntrual cycle all play a part in affecting mood, 
I designed the interface to have those features. </p>
<h7 style="text-align: left;    margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> sketches and wireframes: </h7>
<p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> I began with sketching and wireframing potential design solutions.</p>
<div class="section2" style = "margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;">
    <div class="row-section" style="padding-top: 5pt; ">
        <div class="flex-item image">

<h7 style="text-align: left;   margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> key design choices: </h7>

<p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> &#127793; having a home page that details essential information for the user 
    (menstrual cycle, medication, appointments) <br> &#127793; adding a navigation bar on the bottom of the screen so that users can easily switch pages.</p>

<hr style="color: darkseagreen;">

<h4 style = "text-align: left;  color:rgb(33, 47, 87);  margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"><b> user testing and feedback </h4></b>
<p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> With feedback from peers and input from user testing, I identified problems in the prototype that I wanted address. </p>
<h7 style="text-align: left;  margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> common issues: </h7>
<p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> &#127793; It was initially difficult to navigate the different pages, especially navigating from the Questionnaire page 
    to the home page. Having a navigation bar on every screen would have made the navigation process more intuitive. <br> &#127793; There was confusion about what the circle on the 
    menstrual cycle means. Having an indication of the number of days that elapsed after the last period would have been helpful. <br> &#127793; It would have been beneficial to have a checkmark 
    on medications after a user had taken them. <br> &#127793; It was suggested that we included brief labels for the icons on our navigation bar for clarity purposes.
</p>
<h7 style="text-align: left;  margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> design changes: </h7>
<p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> &#127793; I added more navigation elements, including back buttons and menu bars, such that users can always 
    retrace their steps and return to the homepage. I also made sure to add a caption under each menu items to clarify the meaning of the navigation icons. <br> &#127793; I added more visual designs to indicate where the 
    cycle started and ended. We added small dots moving clockwise on the cycle tracker to indicate the current day of the cycle. In addition, I utilized color to indicate certain phases of the cycle. Red dots correspond to dates of the 
    period and gray dots indicate days without menstruating. <br> 
    &#127793; Finally, I added interactivity with the medication tracker so that a checkmark appears once the user has taken their medication, and addresses the misdirects and broken links.

<p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> I created a high-fidelity mockup in Figma combining sketches, wireframes, and feedback.</p>

<h4 style = "text-align: left;  color:rgb(33, 47, 87);  margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"><b> key takeaways </h4></b>
<p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem; margin-bottom: 5rem"> During this process of designing a mobile app that provides hollistic mental health care 
    emphasized the importance of iterative design. Researching, ideating, and protytping helped my group create an interface that addresses user needs 
    in mental health care. In addition, collecting feedback through user testing provided us with unique inisghts on how we can improve our design. This project 
    helped me fully understand the iterative design process and the importance of revising design based off feedback.
