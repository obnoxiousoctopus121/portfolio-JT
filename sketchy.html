    <h4 style = "text-align: left;  color:rgb(33, 47, 87);  margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem; margin-block-start: -5rem;"><b> at a glance </h4></b>
    <p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> For my final project in CSCI:150: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming class, 
        I designed a program that allows users to create digital art with Java. The program’s functionalities include a color customizable, cursor 
        controlled pen tool, a resizable rectangle and ellipse generator, and undo/redo capabilities. </output></p>

    <h4 style = "text-align: left;  color:rgb(33, 47, 87);  margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"><b> visual and design choices </h4></b>
    <p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> Since this program relied heavily on a graphical user interface, it was important to make careful
    visual and program design choices. I made the following design choices that prioritized learnability, usability, and addressing user needs. </output></p>
    <h7 style="text-align: left;    margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> graphical user interface: </h7>
    <p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> A major part of my program is the graphical user interface. I wanted to design a simple and straightforward 
        interface so that it could have high learnability and usability. Utilizing JavaFX packages, the program interface consists of a blank white pane with a sidebar 
        displaying drawing tools and functionalities available to the user.</p>

    <div class = "row-section" style = "justify-content: center;">
        <img class = "flex-item  heatimage" src="images/GUI.png" alt="Bakery layout with long rows">    
    </div><br>
    <h7 style="text-align: left;    margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> interfaces: </h7>
    <p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> My program was designed to include multiple functionalities to provide users with different options. 
        Since there was more than one shape option, I created a Shapes Interface that I implemented in each shapes’ respective classes. 
    </p>
    <h7 style="text-align: left;    margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> stack: </h7>
    <p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"> To allow users to undo and redo actions, I utilized a stack. This data structure stored the actions of users, so that 
        commands could be pushed and popped to the discretion of the user. This data structure was unseen to users, but critical for visually representing the undo and redo functions.

    <h4 style = "text-align: left;  color:rgb(33, 47, 87);  margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem;"><b> key takeaways </h4></b>
    <p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem; margin-bottom: 5rem"> Creating programs with multiple complex components requires careful design considerations. This project allowed me to practice 
        both visual and program design thinking. When creating programs, it is important to keep users in mind. For this project, I placed emphasis on learnability and usability. 
        It was critical to design and label the sidebar simply, so that users could immediately understand the functionality of each button. While visual design considerations are 
        important for human centered design, program design considerations are equally as important. The program functionalities met users needs with the help of back-end design 
        components, such as interfaces and stacks.
